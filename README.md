WHAT I DID:
Loaded and preprocessed a customer dataset using Pandas and Scikit-learn.
Applied feature scaling and selected relevant features for clustering.
Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (K).
Performed K-Means clustering and visualized results using PCA and Matplotlib.
Evaluated cluster quality using the Silhouette Score for performance insight.
